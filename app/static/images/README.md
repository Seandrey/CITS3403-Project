images folder hold images (new one or multiple added each day )
thumbs will include a thumbnail of the image
tmp folder will contain 5 images of different pix factor, that will be overwritten each day for a new puzzle


note/ideas:
have the images name be string(today's date).(extension)?
create a tmp folder client side and send all 5 images at once? (will work offline)
